Team/Group project: Printf

_printf a funcion to do formatted printing.
In this project the team develops the function for basic printing and format specific printing

1. This will allow us to handle different format specifiers
for better output depending on the desired output

In the C programming language, format specifiers are used in the printf() and scanf()
functions to specify the type of data being printed or read. The most common format
specifiers include:

%d or %i for integers
%f for floating-point numbers
%c for characters
%s for strings

And more others that we are going to see how we can handle them in this project
